## Overview

The Stripe Payment project is a simple web application that demonstrates how to integrate Stripe's payment processing capabilities into a Node.js application. It allows users to select items and quantities for purchase and initiates a checkout session with Stripe for payment processing.

## Setup and Configuration

To set up the Stripe Payment project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and provide the following environment variables:

   - `SERVER_URL`: The URL of your server. For example: `http://localhost:3000`.
   - `STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your Stripe secret API key. You can obtain this key from your Stripe account dashboard.

   Your `.env` file should look like this:

   ```
   SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000
   STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_stripe_private_key
   ```

   **Note:** Make sure not to share your Stripe secret API key publicly, as it provides full access to your Stripe account.

4. Save the `.env` file.

Now you have set up the necessary configuration for the Stripe Payment project. You can proceed to run the application.

## Running the Application

To run the Stripe Payment application, use the following command: `npm start`. This command starts the server and listens for incoming requests on port 3000. Once the server is running, you can access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. When you access the application, you will see the main page with a "Checkout" button.
2. Click the "Checkout" button to initiate the payment process.
3. The server will create a checkout session with the selected items and quantities.
4. You will be redirected to the Stripe Checkout page, where you can enter your payment details.
5. After successful payment, you will be redirected to the "success.html" page, displaying a payment success message.
6. If you cancel the payment during the checkout process, you will be redirected to the "cancel.html" page, displaying a payment cancellation message.

## Customization

You can customize the Stripe Payment application by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the `public` folder. You can also extend the server-side functionality in the `server.js` file to handle additional features or integrate with other services.

## Dependencies

The Stripe Payment project relies on the following dependencies:

- `dotenv`: Loads environment variables from the `.env` file into `process.env`.
- `express`: A web framework for Node.js that simplifies the creation of HTTP servers and handling of requests.
- `nodemon`: A development tool that monitors changes in the code and automatically restarts the server.
- `stripe`: The Stripe Node.js library for interacting with the Stripe API.
- `eslint` (devDependency): A linter tool for identifying and reporting JavaScript code errors and style issues.

## Conclusion

The Stripe Payment project provides a starting point for integrating Stripe's payment processing capabilities into a Node.js application. It demonstrates how to create a checkout session, handle successful and canceled payments, and customize the frontend interface. Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific requirements.
